![banner](pics/promo_title_alt.png)
### A source code of my psuedo-roguelike swordfighting game entry for [Badduck and Eli's epic game jam](https://itch.io/jam/badducks-and-elis-epic-game-jam), written in 48 hours over the span of a weekend in 2020, July.
### See the game's itch.io page HERE : [zikbakguru.itch.io/van-gogh-femurbone-eject](https://zikbakguru.itch.io/van-gogh-femurbone-eject)

## The game features...
* Retro-looking downscaling effect
* 3D camera that supports pitch, yaw, roll rotation
* Procedurally generated weapons & enemies
* Randomly generated room names that completely makes no sense
* Rooms that gets randomly 'selected' from internal list of rooms that is represented by array of strings
* Building mesh / vertex buffer that can be passed to GPU for rendering from given map / tilemap data
* Billboard graphics
* Somewhat in-depth swordfighting system that features parrying
* Retro sfx & music that was synthesized and composed by myself

## Also included : the project files for my sound effects and music.
They're conveniently placed inside of `/SFX` and `/MUS` folder respectively. The sound effect file (`.lch` files) can be opened with sfx synthesizer [LabChirp](https://labbed.itch.io/labchirp), And the music file (`loop1.kt` file) can be opened with music tracker [Klystrack](https://kometbomb.itch.io/klystrack).

## Warning : Since this build is the exact same build as the gamejam build, This game contains a glitch that causes crash, keep that in mind.
